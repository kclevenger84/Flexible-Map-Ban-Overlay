# Flexible Map Ban Overlay

This tool is designed to display an OBS overlay for use when shoutcasting your Valorant or Overwatch 2 matches and display your teams map bans and picks.  Select the game you are streaming, and if it is Overwatch 2, select the mode of maps you will be banning/picking from.

When the overlay is added to OBS, it will show on an overlay in OBS for the casters to discuss during the stream.  In OBS you will need to add a browser source to your scene.  Set the URL for the browser source to http://localhost:3000/overlay.html and set the size of the browser to your stream size (most often 1920 x 1080).  If your layer is not visible, make sure your new browser source is layered above the other sources in your scene.
